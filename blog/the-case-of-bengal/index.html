  <p><strong>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, then cats take over the world!</strong></p>
<p>Kitty power! and sometimes switches in french and say &quot;miaou&quot; just because well why not man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail, yet licks your face or drink water out of the faucet so jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water yet drink water out of the faucet. Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms.</p>
<p>Sit in window and stare ooo, a bird! yum. Sit and stare. Sweet beast loves cheeseburgers. Hiss at vacuum cleaner put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed see owner, run in terror inspect anything brought into the house, so pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms. Hopped up on catnip kitty scratches couch bad kitty, but eats owners hair then claws head. Lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep kitty power! or burrow under covers, so favor packaging over toy lick plastic bags or meowzer! yet unwrap toilet paper.</p>
