## Abstract
**Harness the power of static sites** 

- Speaker: Daniel da Silva (Development Seed)
- Schedule: 10:00 30/09/2017 (Beta-i stage)

Static sites are nothing new.
The internet started with static websites until we realized there was a better alternative and started building CMS that just grew bigger and more complex
Now static sites are a reality again. They are the alternative: easy to manage, simple to edit, cheap to host.
In this talk I'm going over building a simple static website and a set of tools to manage it: [metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) to handle the site generation, [prose.io](http://prose.io/) as a powerful content editor, [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a free hosting solution and [cicleci](https://circleci.com/) for some tests (`echo "All ok!" && exit 0` ;)) and to ensure everything gets deployed without the need to move a finger.
